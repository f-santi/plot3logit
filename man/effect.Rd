\title{Draw a change in the probability distribution on an existing plot}
\usage{
effect(x, y, ..., length = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, y}{\code{numeric} vectors of the first two probabilities. If
the probability distribution is unchanged, \code{x} and \code{y} should
have length one.}

\item{...}{\link[graphics]{graphical parameters} such as \code{xpd} and the line
    characteristics \code{lend}, \code{ljoin} and \code{lmitre}:
    see \code{\link[graphics]{par}}.}

\item{length}{length of the edges of the arrow head (in inches).}
}
\description{
Given the first two probabilities of a trinomial distribution
before and after a change, \code{effect} adds an arrow to an existing
ternary plot. If the probability distribution does not change, a
point (instead of an arrow) is added to the plot.
}
\section{Warning}{

Only when \code{effect} is passed to \code{\link[Ternary:AddToTernary]{AddToTernary}}
as the first argument, arrows and points are drawn consistently
with ternary coordinate system, otherwise \code{effect} draws both
arrows and points according to a Cartesian coorinate system
centered on \eqn{(0,0.5,0.5)}.
