# Ternary Plots for Trinomial Regression Models


## Presentation

The package permits the covariate effects of trinomial regression models to
be represented graphically by means of a ternary plot. The aim of the
plots is helping the interpretation of regression coefficients in terms of
the effects that a change in regressors' values has on the probability
distribution of the dependent variable. Such changes may involve either a
single regressor, or a group of them (composite changes), and the package
permits both cases to be handled in a user-friendly way. Theoretical and
methodological details are illustrated and discussed in @santi2019.

The package can read the results of **both categorical and ordinal trinomial
logit** regression fitted by various functions (see the next section) and
creates a `field3logit` object which may be represented by means of functions
`gg3logit` and `stat_field3logit`.

The `plot3logit` package inherits graphical classes and methods from the
package `ggtern` [@hamilton2018] which, in turn, is based on the package
`ggplot2` [@wickham2016].

Graphical representation based on **standard graphics** is made available
through the package `Ternary` [@smith2017] by functions `plot3logit` and
`TernaryField`, and by the `plot` method of `field3logit` objects.

See the help of `field3logit` for representing composite effects and
`multifield3logit` for drawing multiple fields.



## Compatibility

Function `field3logit` of package `plot3logit` can read trinomial
regression estimates from the output of the following functions:

* `multinom` of package `nnet` (logit regression);
* `polr` of package `MASS` (ordinal logit regression);
* `mlogit` of package `mlogit` (logit regression);
* `vgam` of package `VGAM` (logit regression).

Moreover, explicit matrix of regression coefficients can be passed to
`field3logit`. See the help of the package (type `? 'plot3logit-package'`) for
furhter details.



## An example


Fit a trilogit model by means of package `nnet` where the student's employment
situation is analysed with respect to all variables in the dataset
`cross_1year`:
```{r}
data(cross_1year)
library(nnet)
mod0 <- multinom(employment_sit ~ ., data = cross_1year)
```

The gender effect is analysed by means of a ternary plot which is generated in
two steps, however, package `plot3logit` should be loaded:
```{r}
library(plot3logit)
```

Firstly, the vector field is computed:
```{r}
field0 <- field3logit(mod0, 'genderFemale')
```

Secondly, the field is represented on a ternary plot, using either
`gg`-graphics:
```{r}
gg3logit(field0) + stat_field3logit()
```

or standard graphics:
```{r}
plot(field0)
```
